shared_GO_OR.pdf was made with ~/cwd/src/shared_GO.R 
KP_edges made from WP mat using ~/cwd/src/WP_FDR.R 
square euler made with ~/cwd/src/square_euler.R
There are initially used 199 KP nodes, however the work by Chris classifies 214 ORFs as protein kinase or phosphatase.
Only 191 of those are in the KP node set, so the #potential for KP->KP in venn is 191*(191-1) = 36290.
