# collect all measured nodes and categorize them as KP, activator TF, repressor TF, or alternatively as non-regulator gene.
# Purpose is to allow any node that is regulator to have regulatory effects, even if it is never perturbated.
# nodes.R is used first to get the lists of KPs, TFs, and V, where TFs can be given mode from GO terms with TF_modes.R.
# perturbation.R in another folder has to be run to make perturbation tables before we can use TF_modes_fill.R to fill in the remaining regulatory modes, since perturbation data is used as fallback to infer mode.
# KP.txt is known KPs, KP_KO.txt is KPs mutated in at least 1 perturbation experiment.
