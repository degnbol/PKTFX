# YGR040W aka. KSS1 is a protein kinase and it has edges in this dataset that was supposed to be for TF so it has been separated.
grep -v "^YGR040W" edges.tsv > TF_edges.tsv
grep "^YGR040W" edges.tsv > PK_edges.tsv
# add header
echo $'PK\tTarget\tSLL\tPval' | cat - PK_edges.tsv > temp && mv temp PK_edges.tsv
TF_edges_nodup.tsv was made by averaging a duplicate entry: YNL309W YJL019W
