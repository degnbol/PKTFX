Try on a new branch.
Remove phos_activation concept, but make sure there is at weak majority of activation by checking that the adjacency matrix has sum >= 0 for rows (flip all values in the row otherwise). 
The given weight matrix should not have negative sign on PP and pos on PK, 
but random sign on any KP. Simplification. It can be 50/50 random. I would expect more positive (what we currently tested) but the yeast results says more negative, 
so a neutral 50/50 chance is a good choice.
Check that the concepts of PK vs PP in the network code is not otherwise assuming phosphorylation dynamics (it has the passive phos decay but that works fine as passive activation decay).
